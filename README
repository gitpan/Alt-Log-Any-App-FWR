NAME
    Alt::Log::Any::App::FWR - Log::Any::App which uses
    Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate for file output

VERSION
    version 0.06

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains an alternate implementation of Log::Any::App.
    This implementation uses a different backend for file output
    (Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate instead of Log::Dispatch::FileRotate).
    The goal is to interoperate more easily with other modules that uses
    File::Write::Rotate, like Process::Govern. The parameters are also
    slightly different (no more "DatePattern", adds "period" and "suffix").

    FYI, the future 1.0 of Log::Any::App will probably also use
    Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate.
